<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p><i>Poeta de Tristibus: or, the Poet's Complaint (PdT)</i> was published by
two newly established booksellers, Henry Faithorne and John Kersey,
early in November 1681 (title-page dated 1682). The poem is only one of
a large number of Restoration satires on writers as a group, its nearest
neighbors in time being the pseudo-Rochester "A Session of the Poets,"
the anonymous "Advice to Apollo," Mulgrave's "An Essay upon Satyr,"
Otway's <i>The Poet's Complaint</i>, Robert Gould's "To Julian, Secretary to
the Muses," the anonymous "Satire on the Poets," Shadwell's <i>The Tory
Poets</i>, and Thomas Wood's <i>Juvenalis Redivivus</i>. It differs from these
in its Hudibrastic meter, the richness of its biographical detail, and a
relatively mild degree of animus against its victims, though there is
quite a deal against poetry as art and trade.</p>

<p>In the two introductory epistles, we are asked to believe first that the
poem is the work of a young writer driven into exile by his poverty and
secondly that the manuscript was sent from Dover to a relative on 10
January 1681 in acknowledgment of a piece of gold. It is possible, as
will be seen, that this reflects an actual history; however, the matter
is complicated by the existence of a second text, published by 12
November 1681 (Luttrell's date on his copy, now at Harvard, and
apparently the only one still extant) as <i>The Poet's Complaint (PC)</i> in
which the story is presented in a slightly different form and the text
of the poem is little more than a third the length of <i>PdT</i>. An
advertisement placed in Nathaniel Thompson's <i>Loyal Protestant and True
Domestick Intelligence</i> on 19 November 1681 claims that the rival
version, published by Dan Brown, was printed from a "spurious and very
imperfect Copy which contains only the first Part of the said Poem, the
three last Parts (which are the most considerable) being wholly left
out, excepting some few lines of them foisted in here and there without
any Sense or Coherence" and describes the Faithorne and Kersey
manuscript as "from the Authors Original Copy in four parts (together
with several Additions and Corrections by an Ingenious Person)." In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> a
recent article (<i>PQ</i>, XLVII [1968], 547-562) the present editor has
argued against this account of the poem's genesis, and has proposed the
following hypothetical order of versions. (For the details of the
argument the reader is referred to the article.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(1) An impromptu written as <i>The Poet's Complaint</i> on or about 30
December 1680, for despatch to "a Person of Quality," using
materials from a commonplace book dating from circa 1677. This
assumption is based on the terminal dates of its collection of
quotations from other writers which differs from that of <i>PdT</i>, and
a disparity between the times of composition alleged in the
epistles to the two poems&mdash;<i>PdT</i> claiming "less than a fortnight's
space" and <i>PC</i> "less than three days space."</p>

<p>(2) An enlarged version of #1 in four cantos completed by 10
January 1681. (The "Authors Original Copy.")</p>

<p>(3) The version of #2 revised and augmented by "The Ingenious
Person," who may or may not have been identical with the
"Publisher," and printed as <i>Poeta de Tristibus</i>.</p></blockquote>

<p>It would follow that the near-simultaneous publication of versions #1
and #3 in November 1681 was wholly coincidental. My initial assumption
that <i>PC</i> represents an early draft rather than a truncated copy of
<i>PdT</i> has been reviewed with approval by my colleague David Bradley,
using criteria developed during a study of analogous situations among
Elizabethan dramatic texts. One of his most valuable observations is
that the two versions are thematically distinct, <i>PC</i> being a satire on
backbiting, attacking those who abuse poets and poetry, and <i>PdT</i> a more
general study of the notion "Wit versus Wealth." It is unfortunately
impossible to reproduce his more detailed comments since this would also
involve reproducing sizeable sections of <i>PC</i>; however, the basic point
concerning the direction of copying can be made in another way through
the pattern of variants revealed in extracts from the epilogue to Lacy's
<i>The Old Troop</i> and Dryden's prologue to <i>Aureng-Zebe</i> which are quoted
in both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> <i>PC</i> and <i>PdT</i>. Collation shows that both texts are derived
from a lost intermediary which was in close though not complete
agreement with <i>PC</i> against <i>PdT</i>. This rules out any chance that this
section of <i>PC</i> could be derived from the printer's copy of <i>PdT</i>, and
suggests that the intermediary is more likely to have been the
hypothetical commonplace book or the MS of <i>PC</i> than any four-canto
text, though the second possibility cannot be dismissed on textual
grounds alone.</p>

<p>The only real clues to the authorship of the poem are the biographical
details of the preface and the signature initials "T.W." following the
author's epistle of <i>PC</i>&mdash;either or both of which may of course result
from a conscious intention to deceive. Surprisingly, both seem to be
relevant to the history of Thomas Ward, the author of the hudibrastic
anti-protestant satire, <i>England's Reformation</i> (1719), who is known to
have left England at roughly the time suggested as that of the poem's
composition. In the life of Ward prefixed to <i>An Interesting Controversy
with Mr. Ritschel, Vicar of Hexham</i> (1819), which appears to be based at
an unknown degree of removal on a personal memoir, he is said to have
been born on 13 April 1652, and to have returned to England in the
thirty-fourth year of his age after at least "five or six years" abroad,
a figure which may just be reconciled with a departure date in January
1680/1. However, other details of the case do not fit so well. To start
with, it is hard to see how a man of twenty-eight could refer, as the
author does in both epistles, to his "want of years, and a necessary
Experience in the Ages humour." Nor is it easy to reconcile Ward's
fervent Catholicism with a satiric allusion in <i>PC</i> to non-preaching
bishops&mdash;a favorite topic of Puritan polemic&mdash;or with a reference to the
Pope as "Rome's great Idol." Ward is said in the <i>Life</i> to have been a
Catholic before his departure, and writes movingly in <i>England's
Reformation</i> of his friendship with the Yorkshire anchorite Father
Posket, executed in March 1679. The matter is further complicated by the
appearance of the initials "T.W." together with the dateline "Rome, June
10. 79. Stilo Novo." on a broadsheet of 1679, <i>A letter from Rome to a
Friend in London in Relation to the Jesuits Executed, and those that are
to be Executed in the Countryes</i>, which is in fact an anti-Catholic
tract vigorously supporting the executions. For this to have been the
work of Ward we would have to assume that he had set out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> Rome at
least two years before the departure of the Poeta and then suffered a
violent relapse into Puritanism. On the other hand, if the pamphlet, as
is quite probable, was really the work of one of Shaftesbury's
propagandists in London, there would have been excellent reasons for
attaching the initials of a known Catholic exile. As the year 1679 is
also within the stated date-range of Ward's departure, the existence of
the broadsheet must count marginally against his being the author of
<i>PdT</i>.</p>

<p>I can cast no further light on this mystery beyond proposing that if the
story of the exiled poet is in fact a fabrication, the poem may have
been the work of a younger (b. 1661) and Protestant "T.W." in the person
of Thomas Wood, Anthony à Wood's nephew, later celebrated as a legal
writer, poet, and controversialist and for his fondness for anonymous
and pseudonymous publication. Two of Wood's poems, <i>Juvenalis Redivivus</i>
(published anonymously in 1683) and an elegy on the death of Oldham
(included with Dryden's lines in the <i>Remains</i> of 1684), are satires on
the poets of a similar kind to <i>PdT</i>, while the second has a striking
structural similarity to its opening canto. Neither <i>PdT</i> nor <i>PC</i> is
included in Wood's list of his writings sent to his uncle in 1692 for
inclusion in <i>Athenae Oxonienses</i> (Bodl. MS. Wood F.45, f.#229), nor do
they appear in <i>A Catalogue of Part of the Library of the Reverend Dr.
Wood</i> (London, 1723); however, neither omission need be significant. A
third possibility is Thomas Walters, claimed by Anthony à Wood as the
true author of William Bedloe's tragedy, <i>The Excommunicated Prince</i>
(1679); but I have found nothing beyond the fact he was an author to
connect him with <i>PdT</i>, nor any evidence that either he or Thomas Wood
spent the years 1681-1682 otherwise than accumulating time for their
degrees at Oxford.</p>

<p><i>Courteous Reader</i>,</p>

<p>The following Poem was presented me about a year ago; and (as it appears
by the Author's Epistle to me) was designed only for my Private
Divertisement: But numerous Draughts being dispers'd abroad, by the
Unworthiness of a Gentleman I Trusted it withal, I was more easily
perswaded to Publish the Original, to prevent the Inconveniencies of a
Surreptitious Copy, which, without my Allowance, was designed for the
Press.</p>

<p>The Author being out of <i>England</i>, I would not venture to set his Name
to it; nor have I presumed thus far, without extraordinary regret; not
that I know any other Reason that enforces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span> a concealment, besides that
it was sent to me with such a Bond. I am sure no particular Person can
pretend to any distaste; and <i>Satyr</i> on general Subjects was ever
Allowable, <i>Religion</i> and <i>Government</i> only excepted.</p>

<p>But I must Confess, that in the Third Part of this Poem, there were some
Capital Letters which began the Names of certain Poets of this Age, but
them I have so altered, lest any Offence should be given, that by them I
am sure no Discovery can be made. I will no longer detain you from your
better Divertisement in the following Poem; which, if you have any good
Nature, you cannot chuse but favour, especially if you carry along with
you those several Circumstances which in the way will offer themselves
to you in the Author's behalf.</p>

<h2><a name="The_Authors_Epistle" id="The_Authors_Epistle">The Author's Epistle.</a></h2>


<p>SIR,</p>

<p><i>My Obedience to your desire so happily concentring with my Inclination
to this Subject, has in less than a fortnight's space produc'd what here
you see. To you I need not make any Apology for its Artless Habit, who
very well know my want of years, and a necessary Experience in the Ages
humour; nor can you reasonably expect any extraordinary strokes from one
whose thoughts are divided between so many various Afflictions; since</i>
Ovid <i>himself, when Condemn'd to Banishment, was forc'd to resign that
Spirit of Poetry, which animated all his Works, besides that of his</i> De
Tristibus. <i>Besides, I must desire your Patience to observe, that (the
Verse I use being a kind of Doggrel) it is but Natural that now and then
it should run harsh and rugged; nor do I believe I have done amiss by
forcing my self sometimes to be so very plain and familiar. As for the
Rhyme and Measure, though perhaps they may not always answer the
strictest Law, yet I do not think it worth the while to make any excuse
for that, being faults so inconsiderable, that they are seldom reflected
on, but by the meanest sort of Criticks, who want judgment to discern
the Intrigues of Humour and Invention, which are the Principal
Ingredients of a Poem, and which I must needs confess are here extreamly
deficient: For as this little Poem was written</i> extempore, <i>so it
presumes to kiss your hand in its</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span> <i>Native unpolish'd shape, not having
the least thought or word of it Corrected; for to Morrow being the time
we design to take Shipping, I had not so much leisure as to Transcribe
it.</i></p>

<p><i>I must Confess, it seems unnatural, that one who pretends to the Title
of a Poet, should endeavour, as I have done, to disparage his own
Profession. However, the Poets of this Age, whom it most concerns, I
hope will not take it unkindly of me, since doing thus, I only follow
the Example they have given me; for in that short time of my Residence
in</i> London, <i>among all the Poets I was in Company with, I heard little
else besides their Complaints, and unmerciful damnings both of the Times
and one another. Neither have I seen a Modern Play but either began or
ended in the same Tune. Some few of which I have, for Example-sake, here
presumed to quote.</i></p>

endeavour to conceal a Truth so generally taken notice of: For who is
Ignorant of this, that a Man, in all Professions, except that of Poetry,
may with Honour advance a Livelihood? But that (though it may be
sometimes found proper for the Divertisement of those few who have
leisure to read it) was ever known to be most unprofitable to the
Authors; for few or none have been Advanced by it, though many have been
hindred by this Art of Versifying, from making their Fortune otherwise
in the World. Yea, this Profession is grown so Vile and abject, that
whereas others count it an Ho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>nour to be stiled Physicians, Barristers,
or the like; these are offended with the very Name of Poet: And that
with good Reason too, since Poetry only glories in Disguising the Truth;
for which cause it begins to be Banished even from Theatres, to which
alone it was Destinated; and Prose is now come in request, being
prefer'd for its Gracefulness and Naturalness above it: By which means
this Art is in danger to be confin'd to the Corners of Streets; to serve
only for Songs and Ballads. Hence it was that</i> Ovid <i>was so severely
Punished by his Father, to make him leave off this Art, which proved so
unlucky to him, that he became of a Rich</i> Roman <i>Knight, a Miserable
Exile among</i> Barbarians. <i>Hence</i> Plato <i>was pleased to Banish it out of
his imaginary Common-Wealth. And</i> Philip, <i>the first Christian Emperour,
denied them those Immunities which he granted to all others. Numerous
Instances of this Nature offer themselves to my Pen, but I must take
care not to stretch my Epistle too far, for fear you should Reflect on
it, what was formerly said on Sir</i> William D'avenant's <i>Preface before
his</i> Gondibert,</p>

<p><i>However, I must not neglect to desire this one Favour of you, that
after you have taken the pains to peruse these undigested Lines, you
would be pleased to bestow on them a Funeral Fire; or if you apprehend
that Sentence to be too severe, I do most earnestly beg of you to keep

any such Jealousie.</i></p>

<h2><a name="NOTES" id="NOTES">NOTES</a></h2>


<p>These notes are of necessity selective and are chiefly concerned with
the identification of persons. No attempt has been made to indicate the
complex textual relationships of the two versions. Where detailed
evidence for identifications is not given, the reader is referred to the
article mentioned above.</p>

<p><a href="#Title-page">Title-page</a>. <i>Parve</i> ... <i>quò</i>-. Ovid, <i>Tristia</i>, I, i, 1-2.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_ii">A2</a><sup>v</sup>-<a href="#Page_iii">A3</a><sup>v</sup>. The authors of the extracts are Dryden, Shadwell, Lacy, Lee,
and Banks. The Banks extract is unlikely to have been in print for more
than a few weeks at the time <i>PdT</i> was published. The corresponding list
in <i>PC</i> is called "Quotations" and contains twenty-three passages of
which only two reappear in <i>PdT</i>.</p>

<p><a href="#Page_iv">A4</a><sup>r</sup>: 15-16. <i>Philip, the first Christian Emperour.</i> Marcus Julius
Philipus, c. 204-249.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_2">2</a>: 21-22. <i>Yet ... Liberty.</i> The press regained its liberty through
the expiry of the Licensing Act in 1679. This passage does not occur in
<i>PC</i> and may be one of the "Ingenious Person's" additions to <i>PdT</i>.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_3">3</a>: 28. <i>Cris-cros-row.</i> I.e., Christ-cross-row. The alphabet with a
cross before it as represented in horn books.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>: <a href="#Page_4">4</a>. <i>Honourable stabs.</i> Perhaps a reference to the attack on Dryden
in Rose Alley on 16 December 1679, which was popularly attributed to
various honorable persons satirized in Mulgrave's <i>An Essay upon Satyr</i>.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_4">4</a>: 9-10. <i>Tho' ... Bays.</i> Cf. John Aubrey on the funeral of Samuel
Butler on 27 September 1680:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>About 25 of his old acquaintance at his Funerall. I myself being
one of the eldest, helped to carry the Pall. His coffin covered
with black Bayes. (<i>Brief Lives</i>, ed. O. L. Dick [London, 1958], p.
47.)</p></blockquote>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>: 7. <i>As Tonnellers catch Partridge.</i> A tunnel was a kind of net
used by bird-catchers.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>: 21-22. <i>As ... go.</i> Cf. Donne's "A Lame Begger," <i>The Satires,
Epigrams and Verse Letters</i>, ed. W. Milgate (Oxford, 1969), p. 51.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_6">6</a>: 27. <i>BARBARA.</i> The opening word of a mnemonic used in expressing
the moods of the syllogism.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_7">7</a>: 21. <i>Lab'ring Muses.</i> <i>PC</i> has "tab'ring" (i.e., playing on
tabors), a fairly clear case of <i>lectio difficilior</i>.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>: 6. <i>How a curst Broker met a Poet.</i> The earlier part of the
description seems to be hinting at the distresses of John Banks, who was
reduced to poverty after two of his plays met censorship trouble;
however, the closing section on pp. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>-<a href="#Page_17">17</a> is clearly meant to refer to
Wycherley. It is possible that this is another of the "Ingenious
Person's" additions. Indeed it would have to be as Wycherley's troubles
did not begin until after the date given for the departure of the Poeta.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_10">10</a>: 21. <i>White-Fryers.</i> The sanctuary area on the city side of the
Temple: Shadwell's Alsatia.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>: 1-2. <i>half ... Temple-Bar.</i> I.e., Whitefriars.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_12">12</a>: 26. <i>Being Tragedy, and writ in Rhimes.</i> Dryden abandoned rhyme
with <i>All for Love</i> (1677). Cf. Elkanah Settle's complaint in the
preface to <i>Ibrahim</i> (licensed 4 May 1676): "Another misfortune the Play
had, that it was written in Rhime, a way of writing very much out of
Fashion...."</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>: 9. <i>Where Bread and Cheese he said he'ld buy.</i> This detail has
some resemblance to a circumstance in Shiels and Cibber's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span> account of
the death of Otway, which may derive from a mistaken belief that he was
the subject of the passage. See R. G. Ham, <i>Otway and Lee</i> (New Haven,
1931), p. 214.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>: 14. <i>One who would play at six-pence gleek.</i> The index of
extravagance at gleek seems to have advanced alarmingly in the course of
the seventeenth century. Jonson in <i>The Devil is an Ass</i> (V, ii, 31)
specifies three-pence; however, Shadwell in 1680 was already foreseeing
a shilling (<i>Works</i>, ed. M. Summers, IV, 60).</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>: 15. <i>Creswel's.</i> The famous bawdy house, finally closed down in
1681.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>: 16. <i>Locket's.</i> An ordinary at Charing-Cross mentioned in many
Restoration comedies.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_16">16</a>: 21. <i>the Royal Theatre.</i> Presumably the Theatre Royal, Drury
Lane, although the term could equally well be meant for the theatre at
Whitehall.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_17">17</a>: 7. <i>the briskest of our Crew.</i> Probably Dryden, although the
description has some problematical features. The fact that the poet is a
rhymer and connected with the Duke's house rules out most other
possibilities.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_19">19</a>: 1. <i>Will have a Poet at their tail.</i> Possibly Otway. In <i>PC</i> (pp.
2-3), a shorter version of the description is combined with lines from
the "Dryden" portrait&mdash;the one piece of evidence for the truncation
theory:</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>: 2. <i>Channel-row.</i> The scene of this canto is Arthur Prior's
Rhenish house in Channel-row near Whitehall.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_20">20</a>: 19. <i>A. as 'tis first in th' Alphabet.</i> In view of his exalted
station, wealth, and Whiggish company, it is probably safe to identify
"A" with Charles Sackville, Sixth Earl of Dorset, who is known as a
habitué of Prior's wineshop through the stories of his encouragement of
the owner's nephew Matthew. However, most details would apply equally
well&mdash;in his own mind at least&mdash;to another prominent patron of the day,
John Sheffield, Earl of Mulgrave. In this connection, it is interesting
to note that Mulgrave's account at Child's bank records a payment of
£20/&mdash;/&mdash;made on 14 May 1683 to a Thomas Wood. The name was, naturally,
a common one.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>: 28. <i>And wounds it too with its own Sting.</i> Presumably a
reference to Dorset's "On Mr. Edward Howard upon his British Princes" or
Mulgrave's "An Essay upon Satyr." Both poems may be found in the first
volume of the Yale <i>Poems on Affairs of State</i> series (ed. George
deForrest Lord [New Haven, 1963]).</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>: 3. <i>Next unto A. B. took his place.</i> Sir George Etherege. The
opening lines anticipate Dean Lockier's comment recorded by Spence that
"he was exactly his own Sir Fopling Flutter" which may on the other hand
be derived from it. See Joseph Spence, <i>Observations, Anecdotes, and
Characters of Books and Men</i>, ed. James M. Osborn (Oxford, 1966), p.
281.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>: 17. <i>For you must know he's kept by a Miss.</i> Frederick Bracher
has pointed out in a letter that Etherege was closely connected at this
time with the circle of the Duchesse de Mazarin. See James Thorpe's note
on "A Song on Basset," <i>The Poems of Sir George Etherege</i> (Princeton,
1963), pp. 85-87.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_22">22</a>: 25. <i>Heroick C.</i> Elkanah Settle.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>: 7. <i>Cadem</i>&mdash;&mdash;. William Cademan, Settle's principal publisher.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>: 23. <i>But if you speak one word of's Chumb.</i> Probably William
Buller Fyfe, an Oxford friend who had assisted Settle with his first
play, <i>Cambyses</i>. Fyfe was dead by the time the play reached the stage
and Settle was criticized for bringing it out under his own name only.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>: 26. <i>D. the brisk lack-latine Poet.</i> Thomas Shadwell. The
accusation that he knew no Latin was repeated by Dryden in <i>The
Vindication of the Duke of Guise</i> (1683) and is denied with
characteristic stridency by Shadwell in <i>The Tenth Satyr of Juvenal</i>
(1687). The accusation that his plays were partly written by others is
made by Dryden in <i>Mac Flecknoe</i> ("But let no alien Sedley interpose")
and is present by implication in Rochester's reference in "Timon" to
"Shadwell's unassisted former Scenes...." Shadwell began his career as
the collaborator of the aged Duke of Newcastle and acknowledges Sedley's
help in his best comedy, <i>A True Widow</i> (1678). He was on good terms
with Rochester, Dorset, and Buckingham and addressed dedications to the
two last. The references to Horace and Lucretius allude to the preface
to <i>The Humorists</i> and the opening scene of <i>The Virtuoso</i>,
respectively.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_24">24</a>: 14. <i>Angling for single Money in a Shoe.</i> This line from the
Epilogue to <i>The Libertine</i> (1676) is quoted in context in the Author's
Epistle. It also appears on the title-page of <i>PC</i>.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>: 14. <i>Whetstone-Whore</i>. A reference to Whetstone Park, a street at
the North end of Lincoln's Inn Fields. The name was subsequently changed
to Whetstone St., but has since reverted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> perhaps under the
liberalizing influences of its principal present-day occupants, <i>The New
Statesman</i> and the Olivetti typewriter company.</p>

<p>P. <a href="#Page_30">30</a>: 12-17. <i>To ... pick'd.</i> The reference is apparently to one of the
"posture artists" of Moorfields, another brothel district; however,
there may also be an allusion intended to an incident in the Duke's
playhouse on 23 June 1679, when John Churchill, the future Duke of
Marlborough, attempted to cane Betty Mackerell, an orange girl, and was
thrashed in his turn by Thomas Otway. See Ham, <i>Otway and Lee</i>, pp.
112-115.</p>
